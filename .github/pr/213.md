# build: use file-based manifest for lua files

Replace shell-evaluated lua_files and test_files variables with cached txt files.

- Makefile - add manifest targets (git.txt, lua-files.txt, lua-tests.txt)
- lib/build/test_luafiles.lua - validate manifest outputs against git ls-files

## Validation

- [x] `make test` passes with manifest-based file lists
- [x] `make check` works with cached file list
