# build: use file-based manifest for lua files

Replace shell-evaluated lua_files and test_files variables with cached txt files.

- Makefile - add manifest targets for generating and validating lua-files.txt
- lib/build/manifest-lua-files.lua - validate txt against fresh git ls-files output

## Validation

- [x] `make manifest` generates txt files and validates successfully
- [x] `make luacheck` works with cached file list
