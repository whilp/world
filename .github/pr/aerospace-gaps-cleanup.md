# aerospace: per-monitor gaps and remove workspace rules

Use per-monitor gaps to handle different menu bar sizes on built-in vs external displays. Remove automatic window-to-workspace mapping rules.

## Changes

- `.aerospace.toml` - set per-monitor outer.top gaps (1px built-in, 24px external), remove on-window-detected workspace rules
