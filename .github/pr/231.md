# build: fix make test and check idempotency

Fixed `make test` and `make check` to be truly idempotent - second runs now do no work and produce no output.

## Changes

- **Makefile**: Removed `.PHONY` from test/check/astgrep/luacheck/teal targets, made them depend on concrete summary files
- **3p/tl/cook.mk**: Removed unbuildable files (o/bin/tl, o/lib/tl.lua) from tl_files that were causing constant rebuilds

## Details

The test and check targets were marked as `.PHONY`, causing their reporters to always run and print all results even when no tests/checks needed to re-run. While the actual tests/checks weren't re-running (their .tested/.checked files were up-to-date), the reporters always executed because the targets were phony.

The `tl` module was defining `tl_files` to include `$(o)/bin/tl` and `$(o)/lib/tl.lua` without build rules, causing all .checked files that depended on these (via `$(tl_files)`) to always rebuild.

## Results

Before:
- `make test; make test` → 38s, then 0.18s (printed all test results both times)
- `make check; make check` → 40s, then 3.2s (printed all check results both times)

After:
- `make test; make test` → 38s, then 0.18s (no output on second run)
- `make check; make check` → 40s, then 0.2s (no output on second run)

## Validation

- [x] `make test; make test` produces no output second run
- [x] `make check; make check` produces no output second run
- [x] Tests re-run when test file touched
- [x] Checks re-run when source file touched
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] All checks pass
