# workflows: make pre-release conditional on variable

Adds controls to make the `--prerelease` flag conditional in the release workflow, allowing flexible switching between stable and pre-release versions for both scheduled and manual runs.

## Implementation

- .github/workflows/release.yml - add workflow input, environment variable, and conditional logic

## Changes

Added two control mechanisms:

1. **Workflow input** - checkbox for manual workflow runs (defaults to true)
2. **Environment variable** - `PRERELEASE` flag for scheduled runs (defaults to true)

The `--prerelease` flag is conditionally applied based on the workflow input (for manual runs) or the environment variable (for scheduled runs), maintaining backward compatibility while adding control.

## Usage

- **Manual runs**: toggle pre-release checkbox when clicking "Run workflow"
- **Scheduled runs**: edit `PRERELEASE: false` in workflow env section

## Validation

- [x] workflow syntax valid
- [x] maintains current behavior (pre-release by default)
- [x] adds controllable flag for both manual and scheduled runs
