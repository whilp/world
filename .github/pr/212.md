# extract: set extracted file mtimes to current time

Extracted files now have their modification times set to the current time when extraction completes. This prevents make from unnecessarily rebuilding targets, even when extract.lua is modified, since extracted files are always newer than all dependencies.

- lib/build/extract.lua - added set_mtime_recursive using cosmic.walk, sets all extracted files to current time
- lib/build/test_extract.lua - updated tests to verify mtimes are set to current time

## Key decisions

- **Current time vs archive mtime**: Using current time ensures extracted files are newer than both the archive and extract.lua, preventing continuous rebuilds when the extraction script changes
- **Centralized in main()**: Individual extractors (zip, tar.gz, gz) focus on extraction only; mtime setting happens once in main() for all formats
- **cosmic.walk**: Used for clean, efficient directory traversal instead of manual recursion

## Validation

- [x] tests pass
- [x] linter passes
- [x] verified no rebuilds when extract.lua changes
- [x] confirmed no unnecessary rebuilds on repeated make check
