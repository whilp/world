# extract: set extracted file mtimes to archive mtime

Extracted files now have their modification times set to match the archive file's mtime (with nanosecond precision). This prevents make from unnecessarily rebuilding targets when running make check multiple times, as extracted files are no longer older than the archives they come from.

- lib/build/extract.lua - added set_mtime_recursive function and updated extract_zip/extract_targz to set mtimes
- lib/build/test_extract.lua - updated timestamp preservation tests to verify extracted files match archive mtime

## Validation

- [x] tests pass
- [x] linter passes
- [x] verified timestamps match with nanosecond precision
- [x] confirmed no unnecessary rebuilds on repeated make check
