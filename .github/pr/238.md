# workflows: cleanup and consolidate

Consolidate GitHub workflows and move logic into Makefile:

- Renamed `home` workflow to `pr`, merged `pr-update` into it
- Renamed `nightly release` workflow to `release`
- Removed verbose step names, use only IDs
- Consolidated check/test/build steps into single `make check test build` command
- Added `build` target in Makefile (depends on home + cosmic)
- Added `release` target in Makefile to centralize release logic
- Workflow files are now simpler with most logic in Makefile

## Changes

- `.github/workflows/pr.yml` - combined build and pr-update workflows
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - simplified using `make release`
- `Makefile` - added `build` and `release` phony targets
- Deleted `.github/workflows/home.yml` and `.github/workflows/pr-update.yml`

## Validation

- [x] workflows use consistent ID format
- [x] build target depends on home + cosmic
- [x] release logic consolidated into Makefile
