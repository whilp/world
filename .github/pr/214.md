# build: reorganize makefile into focused sections

Move testing and linting infrastructure from main Makefile to new build.mk file for better organization and maintainability.

## Changes

- **build.mk** - new file containing all test/lint infrastructure:
  - manifest generation (luafiles, luatests, git)
  - script paths and commands (fetch, extract, install, luatest, luacheck, ast-grep, teal, latest)
  - script dependencies
  - all test/lint targets and rules

- **Makefile** - streamlined to focus on core concerns:
  - platform detection
  - output directory setup
  - bootstrap configuration
  - include directives
  - LUA_PATH construction
  - high-level aggregate targets (check, test, bootstrap, clean)

## Validation

- generated manifest files before/after refactor - identical (no behavior changes)
- all tests pass
- build system fully functional
