# example-backend: minimal backend for box --backend
#
# This script demonstrates the interface required for box executable backends.
# Each backend must implement these subcommands:
#   new <name> [args...]      - Create a new box
#   ssh <name> [args...]      - Connect to box via SSH
#   exec <name> <cmd>         - Execute command on box
#   upload <name> <src> <dst> - Upload file to box
#   download <name> <src> <dst> - Download file from box
#   destroy <name>            - Destroy box
#   list                      - List all boxes
#   exists <name>             - Check if box exists (exit 0 = exists)
#   bootstrap <name>          - Optional: called after generic bootstrap
#
# stdin/stdout/stderr expectations:
#   new:       stdout/stderr visible, stdin passed through
#   ssh:       full tty passthrough (exec replaces process)
#   exec:      stdin/stdout/stderr passthrough for interactive commands
#   upload:    stderr for errors only
#   download:  stderr for errors only
#   destroy:   stderr for errors only
#   list:      stdout for box names (one per line)
#   exists:    exit 0 = exists, non-zero = not exists
#   bootstrap: stdout/stderr visible, stdin passed through
#
# Environment: backend receives parent's environment via spawn
#
# Exit code 0 indicates success, non-zero indicates failure.
# Error messages should be written to stderr.
